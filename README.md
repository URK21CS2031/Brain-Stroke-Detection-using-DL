Brain Stroke Detection System
A deep learning-based web application for early detection of brain strokes from CT scan images.
This system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with LSTM layers to analyze medical images and predict stroke conditions.

Features
Upload CT scan images and get instant stroke detection results.
User-friendly web interface built with Flask and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
Designed to assist doctors and radiologists in faster diagnosis.
Efficient model trained on brain CT datasets.

Technologies Used
Python
Flask (Web Framework)
TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning Libraries)
OpenCV (Image Processing)

The backend processes the image and feeds it into the CNN-LSTM model.
The model predicts whether the image indicates a brain stroke.
Displays the result to the user.

Future Enhancements
Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset.
Add classification for different types of strokes.
Integrate patient history for better predictions.
